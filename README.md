# Interpolation_3D
An approximation of a function f of 2 variables x and y, defined into the parallelogram, by building the grid and defining Courant functions in the vertices.

How to set the approximation area (parallelogram):

For simplicity let`s assume that the parallelogram is located in the first coordinate quarter, the lower base lies on the axis of the abscissus 
and the lower left vertex coincides with the origin.

Let`s define 

    a and b - the lengths of parallelogram sides
    nx and ny - the number of split segments on the sides, respectively (so we get the grid of size nx*ny)
    alpha - degree measure of the angle between the sides a and b (from 0 to pi/2)
    
Input: ./a.out input.txt nx ny k eps p

Here 

     input.txt - file that defines a, b and alpha
     k - the number of the initial approximate function
     eps - accuracy
     p - the number of threads
     
An example of running: ./a.out input.txt 5 5 0 1e-14 4

Available values of k:

     k = 0: f(x, y) = 1
     k = 1: f(x, y) = x
     k = 2: f(x, y) = y
     k = 3: f(x, y) = x + y
     k = 4: f(x) = âˆš(x^2 + y^2)
     k = 5: f(x) = x^2 + y^2
     k = 6: f(x) = e^(x^2 - y^2)
     k = 7: f(x) = 1/(25(x^2 + y^2) + 1)
     
The interface part of the program is able to

     by pressing 0 cyclically change parameter k
     by pressing 1 change the content: graph of the function, then graph of its approximation and last is a graph of an approximation error
     by pressing 2 and by pressing 3, zoom in and zoom out
     by pressing 4 and by pressing 5, increase and decrease (by 2 times) parameters nx and ny
     by pressing 8 and by pressing 9, rotate clockwise and counterclockwise by 15 degrees
